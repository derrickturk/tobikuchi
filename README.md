## a pointy stick for fighting (spot) fires

tobikuchi is a simple tool for managing TERR (R) data functions in TIBCO Spotfire. As a "visual analytics" tool, Spotfire falls into the ever-growing category of "secret development platforms beloved by end-users but hated by programmers, with absolutely no sensible source file management nor build system".

Well, thank God for their automation API, then.
